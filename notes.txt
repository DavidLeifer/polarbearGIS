SPATIO-TEMPORAL STATISTICS WITH R
some notes
https://spacetimewithr.org/Spatio-Temporal%20Statistics%20with%20R.pdf

Chapter 1

P.21 How does one do spatio-temporal statistics? Well, it is not enough to consider just
spatial snapshots of a process at a given time, nor just time-series profiles at a given spatial location – the behavior at spatial locations at one time point will almost certainly affect the behavior at nearby spatial locations at the next time point. Only by considering time and space together can we address how spatially coherent entities change over time or, in some cases, why they change. It turns out that a big part of the how and why of such change is due to interactions across space and time, and across multiple processes.

P. 23 DYNAMICALLY, the model says that the value at the
current time is equal to a “propagation factor” (or “transition factor”) times the value at
the previous time, plus an independent “innovation error.” This is a mechanistic way of
presenting the model that is easy to simulate and easy to interpret.

DESCRIPTIVELY, the same probability structure can be obtained by defining the correlation
between two values at any two given time points to be an exponentially decreasing function
Wikle, of the lag between the two time points. (The rate of decrease depends on the AR(1) propagation factor.) Viewing the model this way, it is not immediately obvious how to simulate from it nor what the behavior of the correlation function means physically

Chapter 2

p.44 HOVMÖLLER plot- (Hovmöller, 1949) is a two-dimensional space-time visualization in
which space is collapsed (projected or averaged) onto one dimension and where the second
dimension denotes time

p.51 in order to find the lag-τ COVARIANCE matrices, we consider the cross products of the
residual vectors for each spatial location and each time point relative to its corresponding
time-averaged empirical spatial mean.

p.52 Thus, for measures of the joint spatio-temporal dependence, we consider empirical spatio-temporal COVARIOGRAMS (and their close cousins, semivariograms). The biggest difference between what we are doing here and the covariance estimates in the previous
section is that we are interested in characterizing the covariability in the spatio-temporal
data as a function of specific lags in time and in space

Note that the lag in time is a SCALAR (e.g. has size, no direction),
but the lag in space is a VECTOR (e.g. has size AND direction) (corresponding to the displacement between locations in
d-dimensional space).

Chapter 3

Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW)- average in space and time following toblers law

is a kernel function (i.e., a function that quantifies the similarity between two locations)

Told my ex-wife where I stashed it, just in case
She paused, then she said, "Okay”
Couldn't think of much else to say, a labyrinth is not a maze
That's okay, but that's not the Haze
